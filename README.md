# FlexipodHardware
These are the CAD files of all the compoment in the Flexipod, which are bulit in Inventor.

# Prerequisite
Inventor and a FDM 3D printer with at least 235 x 160 x 190 mm bulid volume.
# Print instruction
All components were printed with a standard 0.4 mm nozzle at 0.2 mm layer height using Gyroid infill pattern.
## Main body
Since the outer skin of the printed parts will greatly decrease the flexibility, so the skins are only printed at mating surface. The parts are printed in 20% infill and 90% flow.
## Leg
The legs are printed with 16% infill density and 80% flow without skins. To reduce the support, it'd be better to print the leg vertically.
